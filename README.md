# DF Smooth Movement

A visual plugin for Dwarf Fortress that makes movement smoother.

## Features

- **Smooth movement:** creatures, hauled items, and vehicles glide between tiles.
- **Synced icons:** status icons follow their creature while it moves.
- **Animated carts:** wheelbarrows and minecarts move smoothly too.
- **Sprites flip** creatures can optionally face the direction they are walking.
- **Adjustable step time:** how long a one-tile glide takes is a runtime setting.
- **Free camera:** the camera can optionally glide and be dragged with the mouse (WIP).

## Installation

1. Download the release archive for your operating system and DFHack version.
2. Extract it into the Dwarf Fortress/DFHack folder.
3. Check that the plugin is in one of these locations:
   - Linux: `hack/plugins/smooth-movement.plug.so`
   - Windows: `hack/plugins/smooth-movement.plug.dll`
4. Start Dwarf Fortress through DFHack and run this in the console:

```text

```
